🔐 Agentic Secure Code Review Assistant

An AI-powered autonomous secure code review system that monitors GitHub pull requests, detects vulnerabilities, analyzes code risks, enforces architectural standards, and automates intelligent merge decisions using multi-agent AI workflows.

🚀 Overview

Secure Code Review Assistant acts like an AI Security Engineer + Tech Lead for your repositories.
Instead of relying only on static analysis tools, this platform uses LLM-powered reasoning agents to understand:
* What changed
* Why it changed
* How risky the change is
* Whether it could break production or introduce vulnerabilities

The system continuously monitors pull requests, performs intelligent code reviews, explains risks in natural language, and can even automate security actions such as blocking merges or generating fixes.

✨ Features

🔍 Intelligent Pull Request Monitoring
* Watches GitHub/GitLab pull requests in real time
* Analyzes commits, diffs, and changed files
* Generates AI-powered review summaries

🛡️ Security Vulnerability Detection

Detects:
* SQL Injection
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Hardcoded secrets
* Authentication flaws
* Dependency vulnerabilities
* Misconfigured APIs
* Insecure file handling
* JWT/OAuth mistakes

🤖 Multi-Agent AI Architecture

The platform uses specialized AI agents:
Agent	Responsibility
Security Agent	Vulnerability analysis
Logic Agent	Bug & edge-case detection
Architecture Agent	Design & structure validation
DevOps Agent	CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes checks
Compliance Agent	GDPR/HIPAA/license checks


📊 Pull Request Risk Scoring

Every PR receives a dynamic risk score:

Risk Score: 8.7/10
Reasons:
- Authentication middleware modified
- Unsafe SQL query detected
- Critical dependency updated

💡 AI-Powered Explanations

Instead of vague warnings, the assistant explains issues clearly:
The password reset token validation no longer checks expiration timestamps,
which may allow replay attacks.
Suggested Fix:
Validate token expiration before issuing session tokens.

🔧 Automated Patch Suggestions

Example:
- const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=" + userId
+ const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?"

⚡ Autonomous Actions

The assistant can:
* Block risky merges
* Request additional reviewers
* Trigger Slack/Teams alerts
* Create Jira incidents
* Generate security reports
* Auto-create remediation pull requests

🧠 Context-Aware Repository Learning

The system learns:
* Repository coding standards
* Existing architecture patterns
* Team review history
* Security conventions

🧪 Example AI Review Comment

⚠️ Security Alert
Potential SQL Injection detected in:
src/user/auth.js
Reason:
User input is directly concatenated into SQL query strings.
Recommendation:
Use parameterized queries or ORM methods.
